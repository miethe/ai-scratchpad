# Hit Song Blueprint – Directory Overview

This repository contains a structured collection of documents summarizing the research‑based blueprint for designing hit songs in the modern US/North American market. The documents are divided by audience (AI vs. human) and by genre to optimize consumption and reuse.

## Files

- `AI/general_fingerprint.md` – Cross‑genre factors that define a hit song (hook timing, repetition, emotional clarity, etc.) with citations. Contains general design rules applicable to any genre.
- `AI/comparative_matrix.md` – A comparative table summarizing key musical attributes across Pop, Country, Christian/CCM, Christmas/Holiday and Kids music.
- `AI/design_checklists.md` – Concise, actionable checklists that encode the blueprint as a set of guidelines for generative music tools. Includes general and genre‑specific checklists.
- `AI/pop_blueprint.md` – Genre‑specific blueprint for mainstream pop songs (structure, tempo ranges, keys, chord progressions, lyrical patterns, production traits, and examples).
- `AI/country_blueprint.md` – Genre‑specific blueprint for modern country/pop‑country songs.
- `AI/ccm_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for Contemporary Christian and worship music.
- `AI/christmas_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for Christmas/Holiday pop music.
- `AI/kids_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for kids/family music (including overlaps with personal ballads).
- `Human/human_overview.md` – A narrative summary for human readers emphasising the most important findings, the balance between evidence‑driven design and artistic intuition, and considerations not easily captured by algorithms.
