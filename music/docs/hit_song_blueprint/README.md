# Hit Song Blueprint – Directory Overview

This repository contains a structured collection of documents summarizing the research‑based blueprint for designing hit songs in the modern US/North American market. The documents are divided by audience (AI vs. human) and by genre to optimize consumption and reuse.

## Files

- `AI/general_fingerprint.md` – Cross‑genre factors that define a hit song (hook timing, repetition, emotional clarity, etc.) with citations. Contains general design rules applicable to any genre.
- `AI/comparative_matrix.md` – A comparative table summarizing key musical attributes across Pop, Country, Christian/CCM, Christmas/Holiday and Kids music.
- `AI/design_checklists.md` – Concise, actionable checklists that encode the blueprint as a set of guidelines for generative music tools. Includes general and genre‑specific checklists.
- `AI/pop_blueprint.md` – Genre‑specific blueprint for mainstream pop songs (structure, tempo ranges, keys, chord progressions, lyrical patterns, production traits, and examples).
- `AI/country_blueprint.md` – Genre‑specific blueprint for modern country/pop‑country songs.
- `AI/ccm_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for Contemporary Christian and worship music.
- `AI/christmas_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for Christmas/Holiday pop music.
- `AI/kids_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for kids/family music (including overlaps with personal ballads).
- `Human/human_overview.md` – A narrative summary for human readers emphasising the most important findings, the balance between evidence‑driven design and artistic intuition, and considerations not easily captured by algorithms.

### Additions from the 2005–2025 genre analysis

The **Music Genre Analysis (2005–2025)** report introduced additional genres and cross‑genre insights.  To incorporate these findings, the following addendum and blueprint files have been added:

- `AI/general_fingerprint-addendum.md` – Extends the general fingerprint with observations on cyclical popularity, platform effects (TikTok, streaming), globalisation and emotional trends from 2005–2025.
- `AI/comparative_matrix-addendum.md` – Expands the comparative matrix with tempo, harmonic and structural attributes for Hip‑Hop/Rap, R&B, Rock, Pop‑Punk, Hyperpop, Electronic/Dance, Latin/Reggaeton, Afrobeats, K‑Pop and Indie/Alternative.
- `AI/design_checklists-addendum.md` – Adds concise checklists for generative tools covering the new genres and sub‑genres.
- `AI/hiphop_blueprint.md` – Blueprint detailing musical traits, structure, vocal style, lyrics, production, platform fit and examples for Hip‑Hop/Rap.
- `AI/rnb_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for Contemporary R&B.
- `AI/rock_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for mainstream rock.
- `AI/pop_punk_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for pop‑punk (rock sub‑genre).
- `AI/hyperpop_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for the experimental hyperpop scene.
- `AI/electronic_blueprint.md` – Blueprint summarising EDM/dance‑pop hybrids.
- `AI/country_blueprint-addendum.md` – Addendum capturing country music’s evolution over the past two decades.
- `AI/latin_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for Latin/reggaeton pop.
- `AI/afrobeats_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for Afrobeats.
- `AI/kpop_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for K‑Pop.
- `AI/indie_alternative_blueprint.md` – Blueprint for Indie/Alternative music.
- `Human/human_overview-addendum.md` – A narrative addendum summarising two‑decade trends, globalisation, platform impacts and cyclical patterns for human readers.

These files live alongside the original documents and are intended to be read together for a comprehensive understanding of hit‑song design across genres and eras.
