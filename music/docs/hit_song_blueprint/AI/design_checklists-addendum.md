# Design Checklists Addendum – New Genres

This file supplements the existing `design_checklists.md` by adding concise, actionable guidance for genres introduced in the **Music Genre Analysis (2005‑2025)** report.  These checklists are intended to help generative systems produce credible songs in each style.

## Hip‑Hop / Rap

1. **Beat foundation:** Begin with a 4/4 loop around 70–80 BPM (trap) or 90–100 BPM (boom‑bap).  Use deep 808 kicks, crisp snares and rapid‑fire hi‑hat patterns (1/32 notes and triplet bursts) to drive the groove.
2. **Minimal harmony:** Employ a simple minor‑key drone or two‑chord vamp; avoid complex chord changes to keep focus on rhythm and flow.
3. **Structure:** Use intro tags or producer drops; alternate 16‑bar rap verses with a memorable hook/chorus.  Bridges are optional; beat switch sections can add interest.
4. **Vocals:** Focus on rhythmic cadence, internal rhymes and ad‑libs.  Consider melodic rap or autotune for crossover appeal.  Ensure vocal personality and confidence.
5. **Lyrics:** Themes can range from swagger and success to vulnerability.  Use slang, punchlines and cultural references.  Keep the hook concise and repeatable.
6. **Production polish:** Leave space in the mix; highlight sub‑bass and percussion.  Experiment with filter sweeps, vocal chops or reversed samples for transitions.

## Contemporary R&B

1. **Groove selection:** Choose a tempo between 60–90 BPM for ballads or up to 115 BPM for grooves.  Use swung or syncopated beats with finger snaps or soft snares.
2. **Chord richness:** Incorporate extended chords (7ths, 9ths) in major or minor progressions.  Switch between relative major and minor to enhance emotional complexity.
3. **Melodic lines:** Compose melodies that allow for melisma; encourage vocal runs and embellishments especially in the bridge and outro.
4. **Structure:** Verse–chorus form with an emotionally charged bridge and a vamped outro for ad‑libs.  A rap feature can replace the bridge to modernise the song.
5. **Vocals and harmonies:** Emphasise expressive delivery; stack harmonies on choruses and use call‑and‑response backing vocals.
6. **Production:** Blend warm electric pianos, pads and melodic bass lines.  Apply subtle reverb and modulation to create lush space without overwhelming the vocal.

## Rock (mainstream)

1. **Instrumentation:** Build around electric guitars (double‑tracked rhythm, lead lines), bass and acoustic drums.  Use moderate distortion and ensure the drum kit has punchy room ambience.
2. **Tempo & riffing:** Write riffs at 110–140 BPM using power chords and minor‑pentatonic runs.  Include memorable hook riffs in the intro and chorus.
3. **Structure:** Adopt the classic verse–chorus form with an instrumental bridge or guitar solo.  Allow dynamic contrast between verses and choruses.
4. **Vocals:** Employ a strong, slightly raspy tone.  Belt choruses and include a sustained high note or shout in the climax.  Harmonies can be simple (thirds or octaves).
5. **Lyrics:** Address personal struggle, rebellion or catharsis.  Keep choruses anthemic and repeat the core message.  Use concrete imagery or honest confession.
6. **Mix:** Pan guitars wide, place vocals and snare front‑centre, and allow some grit or imperfection to preserve authenticity.

## Pop‑Punk

1. **Energy level:** Set tempo between 140–180 BPM.  Use driving eighth‑note or sixteenth‑note drums with double‑time hi‑hats and energetic fills.
2. **Chord progressions:** Base riffs on major key power chords (I–V–vi–IV) with occasional mixolydian twists.  Keep chord changes quick and rhythmically punchy.
3. **Structure:** Follow a tight verse–pre‑chorus–chorus format.  Include a short breakdown or half‑time bridge before the final chorus.  Keep runtime around 3 minutes.
4. **Vocals:** Adopt a nasal, youthful delivery.  Double the lead vocal and add gang shouts or “whoa‑oh” backgrounds in choruses.  Avoid excessive vibrato.
5. **Lyrics:** Write straightforward, relatable lines about relationships, boredom or teenage angst.  Mix sincerity with humor or sarcasm.  Use first person and catchy slogans.
6. **Production:** Keep guitars distorted but clear; pan rhythm guitars wide.  Mix vocals up front with slight grit.  Keep reverb minimal for an in‑your‑face feel.

## Hyperpop

1. **Tempo and rhythm:** Work at 120–160+ BPM and feel free to insert abrupt tempo shifts.  Embrace rhythmic unpredictability and glitchy syncopation.
2. **Harmonic palette:** Start with a simple pop progression but decorate with chromatic notes or unexpected key changes.  Dissonance is acceptable when balanced by an underlying hook.
3. **Structure:** Keep tracks short (~2 minutes) with multiple micro‑sections.  Use sudden beat switches, fragmented choruses and chaotic breakdowns.  Repetition should be used creatively or satirically.
4. **Vocals:** Process vocals heavily—autotune, pitch‑shifting and formant modulation.  Alternate between chipmunk‑like highs and deeper tones.  Include chopped vocal samples as melodic elements.
5. **Lyrics:** Combine sincere teenage themes with absurd or meta‑pop references.  Incorporate internet slang and random imagery; juxtapose earnestness with irony.
6. **Production:** Use maximalist sound design—piercing synths, distorted drums, glitch effects and unexpected samples (cash registers, splashes).  Keep the mix loud and wide but make sure the main hook stands out.

## Electronic / Dance (EDM)

1. **Kick and bass:** Anchor the track with a 4‑on‑the‑floor kick (120–130 BPM) or choose slower/faster tempos depending on sub‑style.  Design a deep, side‑chained bass line that locks with the kick.
2. **Chord progression:** Use repetitive minor‑key loops (vi–IV–I–V) to create trance‑like harmony.  Add sustained pads and plucked synths for texture.
3. **Builds and drops:** Structure the song around tension and release: verse or pre‑chorus → rising build (filters, risers) → drop (instrumental hook).  Repeat the build–drop cycle two or three times.
4. **Vocals:** Feature a strong pop vocalist or sample for the hook.  Use minimal lyric content—anthemic phrases repeated before the drop.  Alternatively, employ vocal chops as the drop melody.
5. **Sound design:** Layer bright leads, wide pads and crisp percussion.  Utilise side‑chain compression for pulsing movement.  Include FX like white‑noise sweeps, impacts and reverbs for transitions.
6. **Arrangement:** Provide DJ‑friendly intro/outro beats if desired.  Radio edits should start quickly with the first verse or pre‑chorus.

## Country (Modern)

1. **Foundational groove:** Select a tempo between 90–110 BPM.  Use a boom‑chick pattern, shuffle or train beat.  Layer acoustic rhythm guitar with light percussion.
2. **Chord progressions:** Stick to major‑key sequences (I–IV–V or I–V–vi–IV).  Include pedal‑steel or fiddle licks that echo the vocal melody.
3. **Structure:** Write verse–chorus narratives with a clear story arc.  Consider a key change or intensified vocal delivery in the final chorus.  Include a short instrumental break before the last chorus.
4. **Vocals:** Employ a warm tone with a hint of twang.  Maintain clear enunciation so the story is understood.  Add simple harmonies a third above in the chorus.
5. **Lyrics:** Focus on storytelling, concrete imagery and universal themes (love, family, small‑town life).  Use conversational language and a strong chorus hook.
6. **Production:** Balance organic instruments (acoustic/electric guitars, pedal‑steel, fiddle) with subtle pop or rock elements.  Keep the mix clean and radio‑friendly; avoid heavy electronic processing unless intentionally blending genres.

## Latin / Reggaeton

1. **Rhythm:** Use the dembow pattern (kick on 1 and “&” of 2, snare/clap on 2 and 4) around 90–105 BPM.  Layer congas, shakers and percussion for groove.
2. **Harmony:** Base progressions on vi–IV–I–V or i–VII–VI loops in a minor key.  Keep harmonic movement simple to highlight rhythm and vocals.
3. **Structure:** Alternate sung choruses with rap verses.  Include pre‑chorus builds and occasional call‑and‑response lines.  End with repeated chorus or chant.
4. **Vocals:** Blend melodic singing with rhythmic rap or toasting.  Use bilingual lyrics if aiming for crossover.  Group shouts and background chants enhance energy.
5. **Lyrics:** Themes often revolve around love, dancing and celebration.  Use catchy refrains and simple hooks that work well for sing‑alongs.
6. **Production:** Emphasise percussion and syncopation.  Add synth stabs or horns for colour.  Keep mixes punchy with moderate low‑end and clear mids.

## Afrobeats

1. **Groove:** Aim for 95–115 BPM with a lilting, off‑beat emphasis.  Layer multiple percussion patterns (kicks, shakers, claps) to create a polyrhythmic feel.
2. **Harmony:** Use repetitive vamp progressions (I–V–vi–IV) in major or minor.  Keep chord changes sparse; rely on rhythmic variations for interest.
3. **Structure:** Build songs around a core groove with call‑and‑response vocals.  Verses and choruses may blur; focus on maintaining danceable momentum.
4. **Vocals:** Employ smooth melodic singing interspersed with rap‑like chants.  Use communal chants and refrain lines.  Group vocals add a communal feel.
5. **Lyrics:** Celebrate joy, love and success.  Incorporate slang from Nigerian pidgin or other African dialects alongside English.  Keep lyrics upbeat and repetitive.
6. **Production:** Mix bright guitars, plucked synths and airy pads with prominent percussion.  Use subtle electronic elements; retain a warm, organic feel.

## K‑Pop

1. **Composition:** Combine Western pop structures with unexpected modulations and section changes.  Typical tempo is 100–130 BPM.
2. **Arrangement:** Write multiple distinct sections (intro, verse, pre‑chorus, chorus, rap break, dance break, bridge) within 3–4 minutes.  Each section can differ in style (hip‑hop rap, ballad pre‑chorus, EDM drop).
3. **Vocals:** Use a diverse cast of vocalists and rappers.  Include high‑energy group choruses, rap verses and soaring high notes.  Layer harmonies and chants liberally.
4. **Lyrics:** Mix Korean and English lines.  Focus on themes of love, self‑empowerment and youth, often expressed through aspirational metaphors.
5. **Production:** Blend electronic beats, synths, guitars and orchestral hits.  Employ dense vocal layering and crisp mixes.  Insert dance breaks with instrumental focus.
6. **Visual/platform considerations:** K‑Pop relies on strong visuals and choreography; generative music should include clear beat drops and danceable segments that can inspire choreography and video concepts.

## Indie / Alternative

1. **Aesthetic:** Favour organic sounds (acoustic guitar, real drums) and textures like lo‑fi tape hiss.  Tempos vary from 80–120 BPM.
2. **Harmony:** Use modal or unconventional progressions; experiment with suspended or add‑9 chords.  Incorporate guitar arpeggios and layered ambient pads.
3. **Structure:** Allow for non‑standard forms—extended intros, absence of choruses or evolving sections.  Dynamics should build and release gradually.
4. **Vocals:** Deliver understated, intimate performances.  Use airy or raspy tones.  Include vocal doubles or harmonies to create depth.
5. **Lyrics:** Focus on introspective, poetic storytelling.  Use imagery and metaphor; avoid cliché rhymes.  Themes often include self‑reflection, nature or social commentary.
6. **Production:** Leave space; avoid over‑compression.  Embrace imperfections and room ambience.  Experiment with reverb and delay to create atmosphere.

These checklists summarise essential design parameters for AI composition across a range of genres.  They should be used in conjunction with the detailed blueprints for each style.
