# Comparative Matrix Addendum – New Genres (2005‑2025)

The table below supplements the existing comparative matrix by providing distilled musical attributes for additional genres and sub‑genres identified in the **Music Genre Analysis (2005–2025)** report.  Only high‑level numerical or factual descriptors are included here; prose commentary belongs in the genre blueprints.

| Genre | Typical BPM / Tempo | Key & Chords | Structural Norms |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hip‑Hop / Rap** | 60–100 BPM (trap often 70–80 BPM with hi‑hat patterns implying double‑time) | Minimal harmonic content; minor‑key loops or drones; simple 1‑ or 2‑chord vamps | Intro → hook → 16‑bar verses → hook; bridges rare; beat dropouts highlight vocal lines |
| **R&B (Contemporary)** | 60–115 BPM (slow jams at 60–90; groovy uptempo at 100–115) | Rich major/minor progressions with 7th/9th extensions; frequent vi–IV–I–V variations | Verse–chorus with extended bridges and improvised outros; rap features common |
| **Rock (mainstream)** | 110–140 BPM, but ballads can be 70–90 and punk up to 160 | Power‑chord progressions (I–V–vi–IV, I–IV–V); heavy use of minor pentatonic riffing | Intro riff → verse → chorus → verse → chorus → instrumental bridge or solo → final chorus |
| **Pop‑Punk** | 140–180 BPM | Major keys, power‑chord riffs (I–V–vi–IV), mixolydian touches | Tight verse–pre‑chorus–chorus cycles; short bridges; gang‑vocal finales |
| **Hyperpop** | 120–160+ BPM, with abrupt tempo shifts | Simple pop loops decorated with chromatic or dissonant fragments | Ultra‑short (≈2 min) pieces with rapid section changes; few repeats; beat switches |
| **Electronic/Dance (EDM)** | 120–130 BPM for house/pop; 100 BPM for trap‑EDM; 140 BPM for dubstep | Repetitive vi–IV–I–V or similar minor‑key progressions; emphasis on buildups and drops | Verse–build–drop cycles; instrumental “drop” functions as chorus; multiple drop iterations |
| **Country (modern)** | 90–110 BPM for most radio hits; ballads 60–80 BPM; upbeat 100–130 BPM | Major‑key I–IV–V or I–V–vi–IV progressions; pedal‑steel fills; major pentatonic melodies | Verse–chorus–verse–chorus–bridge–final chorus; instrumental break before last chorus |
| **Latin/Reggaeton** | 90–105 BPM (dembow rhythm); occasionally faster for salsa‑pop | Minor‑key loops (i–VII–VI or vi–IV–I–V); syncopated dembow beat; clave patterns | Verse–chorus forms with rap‑sung alternation; call‑and‑response and pre‑chorus builds |
| **Afrobeats** | 95–115 BPM | Harmonic vamps around I–V–vi–IV in major or minor; rhythmic emphasis on off‑beats; layered percussion | Looped song forms with call‑and‑response vocals; focus on groove rather than formal sections |
| **K‑Pop** | 100–130 BPM | Bright major‑key progressions; frequent modulations; mix of Western pop chords and K‑ballad motifs | Complex structures with multiple distinct sections, rap breaks and dance drops; often 3–4 minutes |
| **Indie/Alternative** | 80–120 BPM | Varies widely; folk‑influenced I–vi–IV–V or modal progressions; emphasis on guitar arpeggios | Looser verse–chorus or through‑composed forms; dynamic builds and breakdowns |
