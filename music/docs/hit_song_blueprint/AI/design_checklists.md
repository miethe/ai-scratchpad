# Design Checklists for Generative Hit Song Creation

This document collects concise, actionable checklists based on the hit‑song blueprint. Use these as prompts or validation criteria when generating new music via AI.

## General Checklist (All Genres)

- **Hook & chorus:** Ensure a memorable hook appears before 0:30 and returns at least three times【20†L57-L65】. 
- **Title in chorus:** Repeat the title or central phrase multiple times in the chorus【14†L407-L415】. 
- **Concise length:** Aim for 2:30–3:30 minutes【17†L78-L86】. Avoid lengthy intros or outros. 
- **Chords:** Base progressions on the I–IV–V–vi family【22†L123-L131】. Add one twist (secondary dominant, minor four, etc.) for novelty. 
- **Melody:** Keep within an octave (± a third) and mostly stepwise; include one distinctive interval or rhythmic motif【11†L109-L117】. 
- **Dynamics:** Build energy over time (verse < chorus < final chorus). Use bridges or breakdowns for contrast. 
- **Emotion:** Choose a clear emotional theme and support it with lyrics, melody and production. 
- **Arrangement:** Layer instruments/harmonies progressively; end with a full, climactic section. 
- **Fresh element:** Introduce a unique sound, lyric or structural element to differentiate the song【1†L123-L131】.

## Pop Checklist

- **Tempo & key:** Upbeat tracks 95–130 BPM; ballads 70–90 BPM. Use major keys for positive songs and minor or modal shifts for moodier tracks. 
- **Structure:** Verse–Pre–Chorus–Chorus; pre‑chorus builds tension. Optional short bridge or drop. 
- **Lyrics:** Focus on love, empowerment or fun; keep language conversational and repetitive. Avoid heavy narrative. 
- **Vocals:** Bright, polished lead with harmonies and occasional call‑and‑response. Use doubling, reverb and delay in production. 
- **Instrumentation:** Modern synths, punchy drums, bass, guitars; consider a signature riff or motif. 
- **Novelty:** Add a twist (e.g., retro synth palette, unusual instrument like whistle, quirky lyric). 

## Country Checklist

- **Tempo & feel:** Ballads ~70 BPM; uptempo anthems 95–120 BPM. Include shuffles or 6/8 feel for traditional vibe. 
- **Chords:** Use I–IV–V, vi and occasional dominant 7ths or IV→iv. Hold chords longer in verses to showcase lyrics. 
- **Lyrics:** Tell a story with concrete images (small‑town life, family, love). Keep language plain and sincere. 
- **Vocals:** Conversational tone with slight twang; harmonies on choruses. Avoid over‑processing to maintain authenticity. 
- **Instrumentation:** Acoustic & electric guitars, fiddle, pedal steel, subtle banjo/mandolin. Blend live instruments with tasteful loops if modern. 
- **Structure:** Verse–Chorus–Verse–Chorus–Bridge–Chorus. Use the bridge for a twist or reflection. 
- **Audience:** Ensure the song aligns with the singer’s persona (good‑natured partier, nostalgic storyteller, etc.). 

## Christian/CCM Checklist

- **Tempo & key:** Worship ballads 60–75 BPM; upbeat praise songs 90–120 BPM. Choose keys comfortable for congregations (D, E♭, E, G). 
- **Lyrics:** Focus on praise, faith, hope; decide if the song is vertical (to God) or horizontal (about God) and be consistent. 
- **Melody:** Simple, congregational range (≈ 1 octave); repeat worship phrase multiple times. Avoid complex runs. 
- **Structure:** Verse–Chorus with a bridge that builds intensity; allow repetition of the bridge for emotional swell. 
- **Vocals & harmonies:** Clear, earnest lead; add choir or group vocals in choruses and bridge. 
- **Instrumentation:** Piano, acoustic guitar, pads, delayed electric guitar; drums that support dynamics; occasional strings. 
- **Reflection:** Include a quiet intro or outro for reflection; allow space for instrumental or vocal ad‑libs. 

## Christmas/Holiday Checklist

- **Tempo & feel:** Mid‑tempo (100–130 BPM) with swing or straight pop groove. Ballads 60–80 BPM are rarer but acceptable. 
- **Keys & chords:** Major keys (F, B♭, E♭) with nostalgic progressions (e.g., I–vi–IV–V). Add 6ths/7ths or a jazzy turnaround. 
- **Themes:** Love at Christmas, family, nostalgia, winter imagery. Use festive vocabulary (mistletoe, sleigh, snow). 
- **Instrumentation:** Sleigh bells, glockenspiel, piano, strings, brass. Combine with pop rhythm section. 
- **Vocals:** Warm and joyful; group vocals or choir add festive feel. 
- **Structure:** Verse–Chorus (can include pre‑chorus); short bridge or key change to lift final chorus. 
- **Ending:** Finish with a big finale or a warm fade‑out; include holiday wishes or shout‑outs.

## Kids/Family Checklist

- **Tempo & length:** Keep action songs lively (90–130 BPM); lullabies slower (~60 BPM). Songs should be under 2–3 minutes. 
- **Melody:** Use very simple, repetitive melodies (often pentatonic); keep within a few notes. 
- **Lyrics:** Use easy words; repeat lines; incorporate call‑and‑response or actions (clap, stomp, shout). Themes include animals, counting, daily routines, imagination. 
- **Structure:** Simple verse or cumulative pattern; refrain repeated often; clear start and end. 
- **Vocals:** Cheerful, high‑pitched; include child voices or character voices. 
- **Instrumentation:** Toy instruments (xylophone, ukulele), hand claps, simple percussion; occasional sound effects matching lyrics. 
- **Interactivity:** Provide space for kids to respond or perform actions; invite participation. 
- **Positive tone:** Keep mood happy and encouraging; teach or play without negativity.
